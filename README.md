This is a turn-based battle game inspired by pokemon! The goal is to explore and battle with your own monsters to win! Each monster has its own stats! This project is small and not fully complete but there may be future updates!

All the code is within the src or source file! I have included the mp3's and pngs so the struture of the project remains the same!
